    <h1>Applications</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Blood pH Regulation</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The bicarbonate buffer in bloods forces the pH of blood to stay between a healthy ph range of between 7.35 and 7.45. Organs such as the lungs and the kidneys work together to maintain a level pH. Many vital biological processes only occur at a certain pH like the production of enzymes which help carry out various biochemical reactions. A pH outside the healthy range can affect the protein structures required to make enzymes, rendering them useless. Additionally, many cellular processes such as respiration and membrane transport require a very specific pH to work properly.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Respiratory Gas Exchange </h2>
    <br>
    <p>In the lungs, CO2 is released through the reverse reaction associated with the bicarbonate buffer, allowing the exhalation of carbon dioxide gas. Carbon dioxide produced as a byproduct during cellular respiration is converted into bicarbonate to be transported in the blood.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Marine Life</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Outside of the blood, this buffer is taken advantage by sea creatures such as coral and mollusks to build their skeletons. Dissolved carbon dioxide in water dissociates into bicarbonate and hydronium ions. This allows for further dissociation into carbonate which can bond with abdunants elements such as calcium to form calcium carbonate, which is used by certain species of marine life as part of their structure. </p>
